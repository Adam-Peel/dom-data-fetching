# Data fetching in DOM

This repo is a testing-ground for the development of a simple data-feching app, using fetch in the DOM.

This app allows the end-user to fetch data from a single api, and to filter that data through the use of a form.

As a testing-ground the app is relatively bare, and focusses on functionality over styling.
